In This Task-1 i used the crud operations to perform such operations in the Event 
The basic crud operations 
app.get("/",Method) => to get the data
app.getByid("/",Method) => to get the data by id
app.post("/",Method) => to add the data
app.put("/",Method) => to update the data
app.delete("/",Method) => to delete the data
in the task 1 i haven't used the model i used the mongoDb

And in the Task 2 i have created a schema depending on the nudge data 
You can clearly see on the code all the crud methods have been created
and i tried to make them best optimized and you can check it out how it's like 
and the wireframe of the Task 2 is
https://wireframe.cc/pro/pp/23757ab15839036
You also can check it out the wireframe was new too me soo i haven't so much idea of that 

Thanks For giving me the opportunities Thanks
